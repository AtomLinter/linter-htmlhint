linter-htmlhint
=========================

This linter plugin for [Linter](https://github.com/AtomLinter/Linter) provides an interface to [htmlhint](https://github.com/yaniswang/HTMLHint). It will be used with files that have the syntax.

## Installation
Linter package must be installed in order to use this plugin. If Linter is not installed, please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/AtomLinter/Linter).

### Plugin installation

### .htmlhintrc
This plugin will search for a htmlhint configuration file called `.htmlhintrc` and use that file if it exists anywhere in the directory tree.  It will stop at the first `.htmlhintrc` file found.
